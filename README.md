‘Your Choice’ is a software platform that allows groups to securely conduct votes and elections. High-quality online voting systems balance ballot security, accessibility, and the overall requirements of an organization's voting events. There are a lot of advantages that we provide to our users with this app. Fast and easy way of conducting Election, voters can view a description of each candidate, Result will be out after the time which the planner decides when planning the event of Election and users can make their own events in this app. Only android users can access this app. This voting system can be used for casting votes during the elections held in college. In this system the voters do not have to go to the polling booth to cast their vote. 

Users have to sign in into their own account, if users do not have an account, they can register in our system. They can use their personal phone to cast their votes. There is a database which is maintained in which all the names of the candidates with their complete information is stored. A user can create an event for the voting with necessary details with the candidates information. The event can be a public or private event. In the public event, any user who has the link or eventID and password has access to the event and they can vote. In the private event the event creator has to give permission to voters by giving their userID or contact number. Then the valid voters can give their voting and for the invalid voters, permission will be denied. The event creator can change the number of voting times for a voter. After the voting time they can view the results of vote count and winner of the voting competition.
